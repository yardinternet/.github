# Contributing

Thank you for your support and interest in one of our projects. Contributions are welcome and will be fully credited.

## Ways to contribute

Contributing is not just writing code - it's anything that improves the project. All contributions are managed on GitHub. Here are some ways you can help:

### Pull requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

1. **Familiarize yourself with the coding conventions** — read the section on conventions below.
2. **Check the codebase and open pull requests** — ensure that your feature or fix doesn't already exist.
3. **Link related issues** — please link any related issues for your feature or fix

### Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But first consider whether it might be useful to others. Open source projects are used by many developers, who may have entirely different needs to your own. Think about whether or not your feature is likely to be used by other users of the project.

### Bug reports

A bug is a demonstrable problem that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** — check if the issue has already been reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** — try to reproduce it using the latest master or development branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** — make sure that the code in the repository is definitely responsible for the issue.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.

## Conventions

- Ensure that you use the formatters and linters (e.g., Prettier, PHP CS Fixer, etc.) included in the project.
- Adhare to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard.
- Branch names must comply with the [Conventional Branch](https://conventional-branch.github.io/) standard.
